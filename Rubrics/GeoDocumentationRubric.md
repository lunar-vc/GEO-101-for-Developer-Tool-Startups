## Usage Instructions for LLM Evaluation

### Scoring Process:
1. **Analyze documentation comprehensiveness** across all sections before scoring individual components
2. **Test LLM accessibility** by evaluating how easily an LLM could parse and understand the documentation
3. **Assess technical accuracy** and completeness of code examples and API documentation
4. **Evaluate structural organization** and logical flow of information
5. **Score each subsection individually** based on specific criteria provided

### Evaluation Guidelines:
- **Prioritize LLM comprehension** over human-centric design preferences
- **Test consistency** by checking if concepts are referred to by the same name throughout
- **Verify technical accuracy** of code examples and error documentation
- **Assess self-containment** by evaluating if sections can be understood independently
- **Consider developer workflow** and practical implementation scenarios

### Feedback Generation:
- **Identify specific inconsistencies** in naming conventions and terminology
- **Highlight missing prerequisites** or assumptions that could confuse LLMs
- **Recommend structural improvements** for better LLM navigation
- **Suggest technical documentation enhancements** for code blocks and error handling
- **Provide implementation roadmap** for llms.txt and markdown accessibility

### Score Interpretation:
- **90-100 points:** Excellently optimized documentation ready for LLM consumption
- **80-89 points:** Well-optimized documentation with minor improvements needed
- **70-79 points:** Adequately optimized but requires significant enhancements
- **Below 70 points:** Poor LLM optimization requiring fundamental restructuring

### Key Success Indicators:
- **Consistent terminology** usage throughout all documentation
- **Comprehensive code examples** with full context and error handling
- **Proper llms.txt implementation** following official specification
- **Unified documentation platform** with minimal fragmentation
- **Text-first approach** with proper alt text and textual supplements
- **Self-contained sections** that don't rely heavily on external context
