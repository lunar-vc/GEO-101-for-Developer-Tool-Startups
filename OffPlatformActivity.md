# 🚀 Off-Platform GEO Strategy: Building Authority Beyond Your Docs

> **The new paradigm:** If SEO was about keywords and backlinks, GEO is about authority and citations. It's not about who links to you—it's about who talks about you.

## 🔍 Background: Similarities and Differences in the SEO to GEO Approaches

If the currency of SEO was keywords and backlinks when building visibility for your tool online, the current equivalent in LLM optimization is **authority and citations**.

In other words, it's not so important that people and sites link to you and far more valuable that they **talk about you**.

The question becomes: who is the "they?" Who or what are those authoritative entities whose mention of you becomes so valuable?

These are your **off-platform destinations**—websites that are not your own homepage, your own docs, your own marketing materials (blog, tutorials, etc).

They are split between the big obvious websites that are the start of any research project (Wikipedia, Reddit, NYTimes, etc.) to the highly relevant websites that send clear positive signals in the tech industry (e.g., Hacker News).

In the past, in the time of SEO, these types of pages were those that Google ranked highly. Google rewarded the pages based on four factors, shortened to **E-E-A-T** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). In short:

- **Experience** refers to the background of the people creating the content—that they were deeply familiar with the topic. This could be validated by author bio or by highlighting personal experience with the subject.
- **Expertise** describes the depth of the content—and that reputable sources are cited
- **Authoritativeness** refers to the reputation of the site in the industry
- **Trustworthiness** means the site is transparent, seems ethical and is not attempting anything underhanded

In the world of GEO, it is these same kinds of sites that score high on E-E-A-T that LLMs want to pull from when they build their data set or when using RAG.

**If that's where they go, that's where you want to be!**

> 💡 **Key Insight:** LLMs want to offer authoritative answers by relying on other trustworthy and well-reputed sources. If a site is already trusted and popular, then it's very likely that their content is accurate and worth surfacing to the person prompting the LLM.

## 📝 Defining Off-Platform Activity

Let's consider some key sites where you want to be listed in order for information about your product to be visible in LLM responses.

Even if you aren't on these kinds of sites, you can nevertheless be assured that your competitors are.

According to [this article](https://www.kopp-online-marketing.com/llmo-how-do-you-optimize-for-the-answers-of-generative-ai-systems), some categories of LLM feeder sites are:

- Timely and authoritative news websites
- Reputable industry publications
- Established knowledge platforms
- Discussion forums
- Knowledge graphs
- Sources that rank well in the respective underlying retrieval system (Google, Bing …)
- Content that is easy to understand and process by LLMs

This is a great jumping off point and, with some adaptation, you can find the example of relevant sites for developer tools below.

## 🛠️ Examples of off-platform activity for developer tooling

| Category | Details | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **📰 Timely and authoritative news websites** | TechCrunch (🤷🏼‍♀️, I mean what are we, 2015?), The New Stack, The Register, etc. | News - where your PR person would place you |
| **📚 Reputable industry publications** | Academic journals where your technology is covered | Formal writing - serious journals that reflect the technical underpinnings of your project |
| **🌐 Established knowledge platforms (generic)** | dev.to, DigitalOcean community, various Medium based tech publications, Hackernoon, Udemy | Where do you like to read technical articles? There! |
| **🎯 Established knowledge platforms (specific)** | https://planet.postgresql.org/ | Very niche, but impactful within their domain |
| **💬 Discussion forums** | Reddit, HackerNews | |
| **📋 Directories** | Product Hunt, G2, Stackshare, Alternative To, Crunchbase, Github awesome lists | Some are for technical highlighting, others are just to get your name more places online |
| **🗺️ Knowledge graphs** | MAD Landscape from FirstMark, Any tech landscape map, Dependency graph on GitHub | These classify the tool, show alternatives, highlight where it is in the stack. It's rich with information for an LLM. |
| **🔍 Sources that rank well in retrieval systems** | Github, StackOverflow, Medium, Dev.To, Docs Sites, Wikipedia | Popular sites that you yourself trust |

## ⏱️ 15 Minute Quickstart: Build your own list of relevant off-platform sites

### 🤔 5 minute reflection

Take a moment to think about:
- What sites do you visit and trust? Where do you get your information?
- Is it Hacker News?
- Is it specific industry newsletters, podcasts, news sites, etc.?

Collect these sites in a personal list.

### 🤖 5 minute LLM review

See where your LLM of choice suggests you to be by seeing where your competitors are featured.

**First, try running these or similar prompts:**
- `What are the 10 tools that offer an alternative to $YourProduct. Cite sources.`
- `What are 10 tools to help me with $YourValuePropositionHere. I am a $YourICP. Cite sources.`
- `What is the best tool to help with $YourValuePropositionHere. I am a $YourICP. Cite sources.`

**Second, get the sites ready with a prompt:** `Collect just the sources`

Add these sites to your personal list as well.

### 📋 5 minute Plan

With your personal list and your first pass at the generated list, you can begin to build a picture of where online might be relevant specifically for your tool and where some quick effort could get you placement and visibility there. Look for:

- **Low hanging fruit:** is someone on those sites in your network? is there an obvious way in?
- **Good fits:** are there websites that might fit naturally into your launch plans (e.g., you know you have to post on HN)?
- **Creative insights:** maybe upon seeing the sites you get fresh ideas

**🎉 Congratulations:** now you have the start of a quick off-platform strategy!

## 🎯 Longer Term Plan

Once you start investing in Off-Platform activity you can divide the task into:
- work that your company needs to execute on
- work that others need to do

Below are a list of ideas categorized by difficulty. As you review them consider the two levers that your company can pull: **time and money**.

For many of these, you can occasionally outsource the work by hiring a community manager, getting an agency (e.g., [Wizard on Demand](https://www.wizardondemand.com/) or any similar type of shop) or freelancer to write content for you, etc.

Alternately, these may be activities that to save money the company can take on themselves, but of course this takes away valuable time from other key work.

**Find the balance that works for you—it may be different per task!**

## 🏢 Activities you can do (in pure marketing speak: "owned channels")

### ✅ Easy: Less than half a day in total

- **📁 GitHub:** you've got your killer repo set up, readme finished, everything looks clean and ready to download
- **🔥 Hacker News:** ShowHN, Announcement Blog Post, that amazing tutorial on your site. It's on Hacker News, it's getting traction
- **📊 All of the directories, you know these:** DevHunt, Stackshare, G2, AlternativeTo, etc. Not in the mood? [Pay $299](https://launchpedia.gumroad.com/l/product-launch-dfy) to have the nice people at LaunchPedia handle it. **Disclaimer: never tested or interacted with LaunchPedia. You'd need to share how it goes**

### 🔸 Medium: days to weeks

This is where things get interesting.

#### 📝 Get on comparison lists

The earlier exercise of finding the places where your competitors are listed now comes into play. There are two kinds of sources here: the ones that are articles written about a specific tool and lists or comparisons. At a minimum, you want to get on the comparison list. How do you do this:

1. Collect 5-10 comparison lists that your competitors are on
2. Find the contact information and author for each
3. Write a polite reach out to the author mentioning that you think your tool would be very relevant to readers of the list as you too fall into the category they're describing
4. Offer text, *written in the style of the article itself* with the information about your tool
5. You may not always get a response, but you know that if you can be added to this list, it's already a document the LLM RAG system factors in

#### 💬 Post on Reddit and other support forums

- **Forums and discussions** index highly for LLMs because people are speaking in the same conversational language there as they do when they write prompts. As those conversations are usually posed as a problem and result, the interaction seems tailor made for LLMs. Here you can set up a google alert to see when relevant content is mentioned around the internet and be ready to jump into the conversation.

- **For the discussion on reddit, DO NOT SPAM REDDIT!** Rather be active there - answer questions that are relevant to your product. If useful, mention what you offer but in a neutral tone. Do not be annoying, do not treat subreddits as your personal advertising space!

- **An additional topic to consider** is that users often search LLMs for tools with specific situations (how they use it, how many users they have, budget, etc.). This is a prime opportunity to specifically bring this kind of language to Reddit. It also offers a great stepping stone for neutral and factual statements. Language like:

> **Example Response:**
> 
> Founding engineer at **FooBarDB** here, so obviously biased, but here's my honest take:
> 
> If you've got enterprise budget + senior DBAs, **CorporatePlus Enterprise** genuinely has richer features and better edge case handling. You're paying for decades of enterprise battle-testing.
> 
> But for smaller teams? We built FooBarDB specifically because most startups don't need that complexity. Clean architecture, solid performance, readable docs, and you can actually debug issues yourself instead of opening $10k support tickets.
> 
> CorporatePlus sounds impressive in meetings, but if you're a 5-person team trying to ship, FooBarDB covers many of your use cases.

#### ✍️ Write original content for other sites

Dev.To has virtually no barrier to entry to publish. Search https://whopaystechnicalwriters.com/ to see if there are any companies who would like articles on topics you're familiar with. There may not always be a fit, but you can explore what sites seem most relevant. Other options include InfoQ, HackerNoon. The goal here is to piggy back off of well-reputed sites to build visibility. Even if your exact audience may not be on the site, the E-E-A-T factors of the site will still be good for the LLMs.

#### 🎤 Speak at other companies' meetups

Besides the marketing potential of speaking at meetups, having talks at those events will get your name on the related meetup site and in a YouTube transcript if the talk is recorded and uploaded. LLMs may ingest YouTube transcripts, but here I'm fuzzy on the details.

### 🔴 Hard: weeks to months

#### 📢 Public Relations

Hire a PR person and have them do the heavy lifting to get your name across various publications. There is some nuance here—PR takes a while and you may not be featured in the New York Times. Read this [article](https://etels.substack.com/p/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-pr-that) for more information.

#### 🤝 Write Content on Large Partner Sites

If you integrate with big well known products, see if you can publish tutorials or content about integration on their site. Their visibility and reputation can have a big impact, although this is made complicated both by the processes to get on their site and then later the updating requirements because you'll need to go through them each time you want to update something.

## 👥 Activities you need others to do (in pure marketing speak: "earned channels")

By virtue of the fact that other people need to write and create content about your tool, you have less influence and sway here.

**The activities listed below will mostly be an outgrowth of your overall effective awareness building and acquisition strategy.**

To set the scene, there are a variety of activities that others can do to build your visibility off the platform. These include:

- Write pieces about your tool
- Share use cases about your tool (potentially on YouTube)
- Teach about your tool
- Share sponsored messages about your tool
- Discuss your tool on forums
- Place your tool on landscapes
- Create LinkedIn posts
- Mention in books
- Teach in classes
- Evaluate in academic research
- Build connectors
- Contribute to conversation on LinkedIn/BlueSky/Hacker News

This list is non-exhaustive. If you're curious, you can ask an LLM to generate more types of activities with a prompt along the lines of:

```
when promoting $YourTool I have a list of activities that OTHER PEOPLE can do off of my main site $YourTool site. Here is the list: Write pieces about your tool, Share use cases about your tool (potentially on YouTube), Teach about your tool, Share sponsored messages about your tool, Discuss your tool on forums, Place your tool on landscapes, etc.

What are some other things other folks might do mentioning $YourTool?
```

Generating such a list may offer some additional activities that you can more easily affect.

## 🎭 Activities of others you can affect 

Below are three active ways to influence other people's visibility about you of different difficulties.

### ✅ Easy: one to several days

- **💬 Respond to discussions about you:** You can't trigger the conversation but you can use the engagement to correct any misunderstandings about the product, to share what's on your roadmap if it's a feature that they're looking for, and to show yourself as friendly and approachable.
- **🌐 Use your network:** Ask your network to share about your tool on your relevant social networks when appropriate.

### 🔸 Medium: days to weeks

#### 💰 Sponsored posts and working with tech influencers

These can get tricky—to find the right influencer, to arrange a good topic, but are nice in that once the agreement is set up, there is no more work from the company side. An additional downside of sponsored posts is that they can get expensive—certain technical articles and videos can start at $1000+ and go up infinitely from there (e.g., imagine paying $10,000 or more for a technical plug). 🤑 If you have the budget, you can coordinate with [Freeman & Forrest](https://www.freemanandforrest.com/), an agency specifically focused on connecting tech companies with tech influencers easily.

### 🔴 Hard: weeks to months (and further maintenance)

#### 🎓 Find a teacher to make a technical course about you

This involves both a lot of time and money—time in finding the person as well as waiting for them to find a good time to start working on and finishing the course, and the cost of paying them to make it. You could plan several thousands for this ($5K+).

#### 🏆 Ambassador/developer champion program

This is an organized effort where in return for writing and contributions, folks outside the company get recognition and potentially some exclusive perks. These can be very worthwhile for larger companies to run but are deeply labor intensive, so consider starting one with caution.

## 💰 Budget

Like with any marketing project, many of these activities can be done on any size of budget. You can start off doing it at no cost, and if you want to invest, you can do that as well.

If you start to get in touch with creators, you can anticipate that pricing for each project will potentially start at **$1500+**, so you can mentally prepare and weigh the cost prior to putting in the research effort.

Furthermore, while Google Alerts are free, if you want to have a more advanced online tracking software like [Mention](https://mention.com/en/) to jump into conversation faster, that can get pricey fast. I would not recommend such paid tooling from the outset.

## 📊 Monitoring progress

For this entire process, one piece of tooling, however, is very important: **GEO monitoring software**.

A variety of recently created tools are now available at different price points, but who generally work toward the same goal: they tell you how you rank for various relevant prompts and how you compare with your competitors.

**To measure the efficacy of any effort you put in, your very first step should be to set up a monitoring tool!** This will give you the clearest "before and after" to measure which of your experiments, or how your experiments collectively, moved the needle.

## 💡 General best practice tips

- **If someone engages with you online**—for example writes something positive about you or even some longer text—it's nice to reach out. You can offer stickers, just support, or early access—whatever is appropriate. These early champions will be great connections.
- **If you use a monitoring tool for your GEO** (which you should), those tools will often also highlight what sources relevant prompts are citing. In addition to lists and the suggestions above, look into those sources and consider how you might gain visibility there.
- **Everything has trade-offs.** The purpose of this guide is potentially to spark some ideas, but some suggestions are more time consuming than others.

## ✨ This is just the start of your DevRel journey
GEO is only one channel—events, podcasts, ads, outbound sales, etc. are all other options. Experiment across the board - find what works best for you!
